# event-transfer-identification

Supports one API 

1. `<host>/api/v1/:txhash/check`

    Which accepts the transaction hash and checks wether it is ERC20 or ERC721 transactions and returns limited transfer related data.

    Currently, it is only limited to ERC721 and ECR20. This can be further extended to ERC1155.
